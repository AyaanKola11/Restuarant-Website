          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Sultan was born out of a passion for sharing the authentic tastes of
            the Middle East with the world. Inspired by the bustling markets of
            Istanbul, the aromatic spice bazaars of Marrakech, and the cozy
            family gatherings in Beirut, we set out to create a dining
            experience that transports our guests to the sun-kissed lands of the
            Levant and beyond.

            East. Come experience the flavors, aromas, and traditions that have
            been passed down through generations, and discover why Sultan is
            more than just a restaurantâ€”it's a destination.
